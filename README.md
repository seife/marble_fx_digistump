# USB converter for Trackman MarbleFX
The famous Logitech Trackman MarbleFX trackball has four buttons, of which the 4th (red) button was used to emulate a scroll wheel.
To enable this, the trackball needs to be switched into a special Logitech PS/2 protocol, which enables the reporting of the additional button.
This works well on Linux, but only if the trackball is connected via a native PS/2 port.

If a simple PS/2 <-> USB converter is used, the trackball operates in "legacy" 3-button Mouse mode, because those converters do not know how to switch and interpret the logitech protocol.

This project uses a Digispark ATTiny85 to interface the TrackmanFX's PS/2 port to USB HID.

The smallest boards can be integrated directly into the trackball, so that the TrackmanFX appears as a "native" USB device.

One example of such a modification is [here](doc/README.md).
